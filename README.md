# admin-module
To RUN

First open the project in IDE I have used Intellij and under the src-main-java folder there is a controller package with one class inside it InternalAdminDriver class that has a main method where the application starts.

A high level overview of how you spent your time
I spent around 1 plus one half day.


A description of your process and approach, including what you think you would have done differently given more time.

I started by consuming Endpoints using HttpClient and the method I have used is found in DataSource class.
Then I wrote a method based on the problem discription and requirments that has 4 functionality 
  *haveAPaymentPlan()
  *isPaymentCompleted()
  *paidDebt()
  *setPaymentDueDate()

I used Java 8 to perform those operation which makes this code easier to read and test and then I inovoked those method from InternalAdminDriver class where main method found. I beileve I should have prepare more test cases but due to limit time I have I tested only a few use cases.

Thanks.
